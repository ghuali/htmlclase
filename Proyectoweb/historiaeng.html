            The City
A metropolis of corporate nesting

Our immense City is divided into 26 Districts, each unique in its technological advancements and culture. The "Nests" are the 26 provinces of the City, and each one is taken care of by its "Wings," the 26 largest conglomerates. Under the jurisdiction of a Wing, citizens enjoy comfortable and secure lives. However, if a Wing loses its power, no one can guarantee your safety in its Nest, Executive Manager.

The "Alleys" are the dangerous regions of the City, where your safety is not guaranteed. Although the Nests also have their risks, the Alleys are full of taboos and rich cultural diversity. Citizens can form "Syndicates" of various sizes. Additionally, between 3:13 AM and 4:34 AM, known as the "Night in the Alleys," no assistance can be provided to the Executive Manager.

The "Fixers" are the City's workers who handle various cases and incidents. To officially hire a Fixer, you must go to an Office authorized by the Associations or visit them in person. If you need someone to handle an "unreasonable" job, bring a lot of money and go directly to an Association, where Fixers cannot refuse missions.
